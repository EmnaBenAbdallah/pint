In this paper, we introduce a framework allowing to model and analyse efficiently Gene Regulatory
Networks (GRNs) in their temporal and stochastic aspects. The analysis of stable states and
inference of René Thomas’ discrete parameters derives from this logical formalism. We offer a
compositional approach which comes with a natural translation to the Stochastic π-Calculus. The
method we propose consists in successive refinements of generalised dynamics of GRNs. We illustrate
the merits and scalability of our framework on the control of the differentiation in a GRN
generalising metazoan segmentation processes, and on the analysis of stable states within a large
GRN studied in the scope of breast cancer researches.

In this paper, we develop a framework for an efficient under-approximation of
the dynamics of Asynchronous Automata Networks (AANs). An AAN is an Automata
Network with synchronised transitions between automata, where each transition
changes the local state of exactly one automaton (but any number of
synchronising local states are allowed). The work we propose here is based on
static analysis by abstract interpretation, which allows to prove that reaching
a state with a given property is possible, without the same computational cost
of usual model checkers: the complexity is polynomial with the total number of
local states and exponential with the number of local states within a single
automaton. Furthermore, we address AANs with classes of priorities, and give an
encoding into AANs without priorities, thus extending the application range of
our under-approximation. Finally, we illustrate our method for the model
checking of large-scale biological networks.

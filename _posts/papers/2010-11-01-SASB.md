Analysing dynamics of large biological regulatory networks (BRNs) calls for innovative methods to
cope with the state space explosion. Static analysis and abstract interpretation techniques seem
promising approaches. In this paper, we address the Process Hitting framework, that has been shown
of interest to model dynamics of BRNs with discrete values. We propose to take profit from the
particular structures of Process Hitting to build efficient static analyses. We introduce a novel
and original method to decide the reachability of the state of a component within a BRN modelled in
Process Hitting. The decision is achieved by abstract interpretation and static analysis of Process
Hittings. The scalability of our approach is illustrated by its application to the analysis of a BRN
with 40 components.

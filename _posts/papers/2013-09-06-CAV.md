In the scope of discrete finite-state models of interacting components, we present a novel algorithm
for identifying sets of local states of components whose activity is necessary for the reachability
of a given local state. If all the local states from such a set are disabled in the model, the
concerned reachability is impossible.

Those sets are referred to as cut sets and are computed from a particular abstract causality
structure, so-called Graph of Local Causality, inspired from previous work and generalised here to
finite automata networks. The extracted sets of local states form an under-approximation of the
complete minimal cut sets of the dynamics: there may exist smaller or additional cut sets for the
given reachability.

Applied to qualitative models of biological systems, such cut sets provide potential therapeutic
targets that are proven to prevent molecules of interest to become active, up to the correctness of
the model.
Our new method makes tractable the formal analysis of very large scale networks, as illustrated by
the computation of cut sets within a Boolean model of biological pathways interactions gathering
more than 9000 components.

#### Pint API

All functions implemented in Pint are available through an OCaml library that can be embedded in
other programs.
The library is compiled by executing `make libpint` in the source directory and is named
`pint.cmxa`.

`pintc file.ml` can be used as a shortcut to compile OCaml code against the pint library.

`pint` is an OCaml interactive toplevel embedding the Pint modules.

Please refer to the [Pint API](http://loicpauleve.name/pint/docs/api/).


#### Source repository

The current sources of Pint are hosted on [github](https://github.com/pauleve/pint).

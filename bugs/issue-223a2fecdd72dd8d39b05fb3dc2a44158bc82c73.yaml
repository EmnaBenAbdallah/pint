title: improve cooperativities initialisation
desc: |-
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/pint/+bug/644281
  The current implementation doesn't seem to support nested cooperativities when initializing their states.
  A possible solution would be to use local stable state analysis and pick a stable state that match the global initial state.
